- 👋 Hi, I’m Anupam Shaw, an undergraduate student at the Department of Physics, Sardar Vallabhbhai National Insititute of Technology, Surat, India.
- 👀 I’m interested in scientific computing and numerical simulations especially for the purpose of understanding the concepts of Physics in an efficient manner.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Julia, Mathematica, Octave, Python
- 📫 How to reach me? You can email me at anupamshaw@outlook.com
- 📷 Yes. The boy in the picture is me. The picture was taken maybe around 2008.

<!--- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that includes learning and implementation of computational tools for visualising and modelling physical concepts.--->
